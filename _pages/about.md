I am a Quantum Error Correction Researcher with [Xanadu Quantum Technologies](https://xanadu.ai/). Previously, I was a graduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Prof. Pradeep Sarvepalli](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/pradeep/). My research interests are broadly in the fields of fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum error correction, photonic quantum computation, and classical information and coding theory.
